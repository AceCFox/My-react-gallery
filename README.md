# React Gallery

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Project_

My first build with react and material UI.  This app allows a user to add photos with descriptions, the photos are displaed in a gallery below with their decriptions "behind" them. When clicked, the images are swapped with their description. A user can "like" or delete each photo by clicking the appropriate icon buttons. 

## Screen Shot

Include one or two screen shots of your project here (optional). Remove if unused.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- 

## Installation


1. Create a database named `react_gallery`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
